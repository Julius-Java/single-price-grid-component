## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- I learned about the :not(:last-child) pseudo-selector and in this project, I use it to target all but not the last element in the parent element, code sample below

```css
:not(:last-child) {
    margin-bottom: 16px;
}
```


### Continued development

I hope to get better at building complex responsive designs using the flex system
